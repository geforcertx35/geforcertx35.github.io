# All about Lasagna 
## Where is started 
Lasagna, Italy's beloved dish made popular by decadent layers of pasta, meat, cheese, and sauce, has its roots in ancient Greece and Rome, where early forms of layered pasta were baked. The modern form of lasagna emerged in Naples in the Middle Ages, which evolved with the introduction of tomatoes in Italian cuisine in the 16th century. It then evolved into a staple in Italian families and regional variation emerged, particularly between Northern and Southern Italy.


## When did it become popular 
Lasagna gained popularity worldwide in the 20th century, especially in Europe and the United States, because of Italian emigration and international growth of Italian restaurants. It is now a comfort food staple around the world, famous for its rich flavors and versatility.
